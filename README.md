# Bullet
A Unity Game
Bullet is a game where you play as a purple pixel. On the screen there is a randomly rotating turret that will shoot green pixels. The green pixels will bounce around on the screen, and as the game progresses more green pixels will be bouncing around. Your task is to survive for as long as possible without touching the green pixels.
